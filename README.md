# LemonadeStand
Run a business, run a lemonade stand

My attempt at making the 1979 version of Lemonade Stand in java.

I've been following along with
https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/blob/master/basic/LemonadeStand/lemonade.bas
which is also using
http://www.codenautics.com/lemonade/
as guide to build a Java version.

A playable version of Lemonade Stand (1979) can be found here:
