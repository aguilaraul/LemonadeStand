# LemonadeStand
Run a business, run a lemonade stand

My attempt at making the 1979 version of Lemonade Stand in java.

I've been following along with
https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/blob/master/basic/LemonadeStand/lemonade.bas
which is also using
http://www.codenautics.com/lemonade/
as guide to build a Java version.


DONE:
* Fixed all checks
* Added random events
* Keep the same weather and chance for multiple players
* Add bankruptcy state
* Put financial report at the end of day
* Display endgame screen

TODO:
* Fix formatting
* Optimize chance of selling lemonade
* Make it all in JFrame
